"""store_core — envelope v1 append/read for JSONL stores (MemKraft 2.13, S1+S2).

Atomic single-line appends and sequential reads over a JSONL file. Each
record is wrapped in an envelope: ``id`` and ``created_at`` (UTC ISO-8601)
are filled in when the caller omits them; ``schema_version`` is always
normalized to 1 (envelope metadata, not caller data); all caller-supplied
payload fields are preserved as-is.

API (internal tier):
    append(path, record) -> dict          # the enveloped record as written
    read_all(path, include_tombstoned=False) -> ReadResult
    mark_tombstone(path, record_id) -> dict   # the appended marker record
    compact(path) -> CompactResult        # physical removal (S3)

Tombstones (S2): the store is append-only — ``mark_tombstone`` never
rewrites existing lines; it appends a marker record
``{"tombstone": true, "tombstone_of": <id>}``. ``read_all`` hides, by
default, records carrying ``tombstone: true`` (markers included) and any
record whose ``id`` is targeted by a marker; ``include_tombstoned=True``
exposes everything (compaction/audit path).

Concurrency: append takes an ``fcntl.flock`` exclusive lock on the store
file and writes the whole newline-terminated line with a single
``os.write`` call, so concurrent appenders never interleave bytes. Because
``compact`` swaps the store to a new inode with ``os.replace`` while
holding that lock, every locker re-stats the path after acquiring the lock
and retries on a fresh descriptor if the inode changed — otherwise a
writer that queued on the old inode would append to an orphaned file and
the record would be silently lost (S4 concurrency gate).

Compaction (S3): ``compact`` physically drops tombstone markers, the
records they target, and corrupt lines, preserving live lines byte-for-byte
in file order. It rewrites through ``<store>.compact.tmp`` in the same
directory and swaps it in with ``os.replace``, so a kill mid-compact leaves
either the original or the finished file; a stale temp from an interrupted
run is discarded by the next compact (or by this one, via the replace).
Automatic compaction triggers and snapshots are out of scope (S4+).

Zero dependencies — stdlib only.
